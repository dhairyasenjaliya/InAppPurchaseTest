# Setup 

Install pods and npm packages.

Run `npm install`. Run `cd /ios && pod install`.

Check For Issue 

I have installed uinmodules and it works properly on android. However, I'm not able to link expo-in-app-purchases correctly. I get the following error

ExceptionsManager.js:179 Invariant Violation: Native module cannot be null

ExceptionsManager.js:179 Invariant Violation: Module AppRegistry is not a registered callable module (calling runApplication)

I've run npx pod-install etc
